# organization
Cryptic collects up-to-date data from website APIs and provides analytic tools to assess "alt-coin" cryptocurrencies for investment purposes.  Provisional workflow:

- notes, analysis, and conclusions (markdown) kept at `./docs`.  Viewable at: https://tcrensink.github.io/cryptic/
- each API endpoint is stored in a unique pandas DataFrame and regularly updated (in `./data`)
- DataFrames merged to a master DataFrame for convenient analysis (`./data`)
- shared class/functions stored in `./lib`
- ready-to-run scripts in `./analysis`
- rough code in `testcode.py`
